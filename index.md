## Basic Datatypes in Python

## Numbers
Number data types contain integers
- We can use the type() function to confirm this.


```python
 first_number = 123
 second_number = 456
 print(first_number, second_number) #123 456

 #Checking type of variable
 print('The type is ',type(first_number))

 ```
